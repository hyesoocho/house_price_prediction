## House price prediction in Iowa from Kaggle
- Predicted house prices based on analysis of 79 variables that describe aspect of house using advanced regression techniques in R
- Conducted exploratory data analysis (univariate analysis of outcome and explanatory variables and visualization)
- Evaluated missing data and mechanisms of missingness
- Performed data cleaning and handle multicollinearity issues
- Created training block and test block by randomly splitting the samples from the training dataset into two blocks to validate the model's accuracy
- Built Random Forest and Lasso models to identify statistical significance of variables and to calculate each test error
- Utilized cross-validation to select appropriate values for tuning parameters for random forest
- Identified which method yields smaller test error and determine final model to fit model to the whole available data 
- Demonstrated 10 important features and effects of each price change to share insights and recommendations to stakeholders 

## Executive summary
Based on the Kaggle data, advanced regression techniques were performed to predict home price given the features of the home based on analysis of 79 explanatory variables describing every aspect of residual homes in Ames, Iowa. Missing data and multicollinearity were handled, and within the same training dataset, it split into two blocks 
Random Forest and Lasso models were performed to 
which models yield smaller test error to predict home price. 
given the features of the home based on analysis of 79 explanatory variables describing every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa.
